# Indurative

Indurative is a project to explore automatically deriving [authenticated](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~mwh/papers/gpads.pdf) versions of common data structures with [DerivingVia](https://www.kosmikus.org/DerivingVia/deriving-via-paper.pdf). Right now, it works (somewhat inefficiently) for an `FoldableWithIndex` with serializable keys and values, and orderable keys. Eventually, it might do more interesting stuff.
